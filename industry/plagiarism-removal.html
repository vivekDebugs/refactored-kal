                <p>
                    In layman terms, plagiarism refers the usage of words or ideas of another as your own. If you read about some idea in some book by someone and use it in your work stating that idea is yours, it is plagiarism. If you acknowledge that someone whose idea it was while putting it down in your work, it is a citation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quoting another example of plagiarism, if you come across someone who has written about a topic that you’re also attempting to write on and use his/her ideas on that topic as your own idea in your own paper, it is plagiarism. Here again, if you are acknowledging the source, it is merely a citation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another implicit way of plagiarism is to use the idea of someone else as your own but incorporating them into your own work using different words other than that of the author. But, this is not considered plagiarism by most software’s that detect plagiarized content. Technicalities play an important role here too, like in make other areas of research.

                <p>
                    The prime concern of any research scholar is to create a dissertation that is devoid of copied material from any other source since it is considered most brutal of errors one can make in research. Every research scholar wants to give a competent piece of work without having to compromise on their integrity and hard work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter what kind of writer you are, you simply cannot afford to turn in inferior work. Content contaminated with grammatical errors and misspellings will prevent you from succeeding. Grades could go low, and dissertations could be considered worthless due to plagiarism. That is why we give special importance to editing dissertations and assignments off plagiarized content and offer the most advanced ways of detecting plagiarism and nullifying the problem without losing the ideas conveyed by the research scholar.
